                    This is the peak form of web development, simple, fast, and lightweight. You don't need megabytes of
                    bloated javascript for a site to look pretty. Have you ever tested your site in
                    <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a>?, do you even know about it? if your site scored less
                    than B you might want to stop.
                    and look back at what you have done.
                    <br> Nobody even cares about their website performance, by this
                    computer back then was faster because everyone was thinking about their website performance before
                    releasing it, nowadays web development is going full retard mode, throwing as much shit as avalable just to make it look 'Pretty'.
                    <br>Do people care about what are they writing anymore? or even know what are they writing?
                    <br>Here are something you need know : 
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page is 3KB large, most load come from the image which should be optimized to a better format(webp)</li>
                        <li>The whole stylesheet of this site is under 2KB, further reduction may continue</li>
                        <li>Try to not use javascript until you REALLY NEED IT</li>
                        <li>This whole website is 3MB big, mostly comes from images, all pages and stylesheet combined is less than 5KB may increase with further posts</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
