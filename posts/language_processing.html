                One of many difficult things to learn the older you're is languange, I'm not going to explain why
                because it's entirely outside my understanding. Personally I'm fluent in three language having two
                native and one foreign, all of which are learned in my youth. in this article I'm going to write
                my thoughts on this subject, especially the way the brain process language.
                <br>To make it easy English is going to be our primary language, and italian for the foreign languange
                in this article.

                <br><img src="../res/images/lang/1.png" alt="" class="image-content">

                <br>When something is spoken in English optimally you instantly understand the meaning, but in
                the case of foreign languange, if you're not yet fluent in it, firstly your brain will have to translate
                it to English to find the meaning of that word, if that fails you won't understand it.
                <br>When you're already fluent in both English and Italian, Seemingly you would instantly understand the
                meaning without having to translate it to English first.
                <br>The same process also applicable to foreign alphabet, it would have to go to roman alphabet first to
                translate it.
                <br>That's all I currently have in mind, if another thing comes up I will continue.
