                <h1>Simple Robotics - Incomplete</h1>
                <hr>
                Created : 2020-12-11 | Author : Fish
                <hr>
                Let's start by a simple definition of a robot, a machine to do human task to lessen manpower or make
                more efficient. The simplest form of them are to replace menial works (moving stuff, monitoring, etc)
                currently we have all the resource available to make robot to a lot of things, even complicated one but
                their development seems to be slow, why is that?
                <ul>
                    <li>Arduino makes creating robots way easier than before</li>
                    <li>Sensors are very cheap and there's a lot of their variants (water level, distance, heat, camera,
                        etc)</li>
                    <li>Pre-assembled electrical modules are avalable, allowing creation with basic knowledge of
                        electricity (Voltage booster, Motor controller, etc)</li>
                    <li>3D printer are getting cheaper and better, but it requires some skill with 3D modelling to build
                        your own model but it's quite easy actually</li>
                </ul>
                Maybe the overcomplication of development is one to blame, see my <a href="../index.html">homepage</a>
                about that, stuffs gets more complicated making it harder to a lot of people to understand and do,
                and people tend to act when the danger is already in front of their face, WW1, WW2, and Cold
                War accelerates a lot of research, having a competition forces us to race the enemy first before they
                reach us by getting an advantage at a technology, but there's no competition today, humanity is since is
                on full procastination mode just taking it easy because there is no threat to not do it, as quoted from
                Johnny Got His Gun.
                <p><i>"War has a various meanings to various persons, to the scientist, war means that he is actually
                        set
                        free to accomplish his most brilliant and most imaginative enterprises. For example, in previous
                        wars, each injury has resulted in a very serious loss to the taxpayers the loss of a most
                        expensively trained soldier or a fighting unit as we call him now. However, in the next war we
                        shall be able to repair and deliver that same fighting unit to the frontline trenches in three
                        weeks or even less. And all bacause of the radical new techniques which this young man has
                        taught us."</i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Haber-Bosch process creates fertilizers and explosives, allowing the German Empire to
                        produce munitions.</li>
                    <li>The tank, in order for it to do well we need a better engine, better armor, better guns
                        and everything. There's a lot of work and research just to make the perfect war machine, but of
                        course the research will benefit everyone when the war is over.</li>
                    <li>Aeronautics accelerates very fast, when first used both sides began so see it's benefits so they
                        race each other to make the best airplane.</li>
                    <li>And the most important, Nuclear physics, when the American first used it the whole world was
                        shaken by its power, not for long the Soviet Unions makes their own, and then it got bigger
                        yields and more efficient, indirectly this progress increased our understanding in particle
                        physics.</li>
                </ul>
                Got sidetracked for a bit back to the main topic, those points SHOULD make someone that is interested in robotics do
                their jobs easier, for now let's list some avtivites that can be automated by robots and how one can
                create them.
                <h2>Farming</h2>
                We know by now not a lot of people are interested in it the world population keeps on increasing and <a
                    href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS">farmers are decreasing</a>, by that
                farming is the most crucial job to automate bacause no one is interested in it, but then unforseen
                consequences might follow if we do this path
